Hi, hello!

My name is Nick Gregorich, I'm an engineer. I started out as an electrical engineer, but I decided I liked software and especially data even better. I find products and / or organizations often have gaps between hardware and software that can usually be solved with data: that's where I step in

Lately I've been reminiscent of the internet I grew up on. The *old* internet, before likes and analytics and doom scrolling. I remember participating more on that internet, posting on forums and blogs. *Creating*, not consuming

Since then, I have been finding joy in writing documentation in Confluence / Coda / Quip (miss you, baby) at my day jobs and more recently mentoring junior engineers. I'd like to channel some of that creative output into blogging

I decided to keep it simple, so you can contact me via [email](mailto:blog@nickgregorich.com) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nick-gregorich/). Drop me a line, I'd love to chat!

Nick
